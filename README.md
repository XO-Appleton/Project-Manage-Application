<p>Run python3 announcementProxy.py</p>

<p>This will treat the current user as a user with the login name "Benjamin_Moore". It will start the announcement branch and deliver the main landing page of the announcements that belong to the project (in this case those that belong to project_ID == 2). By answering the input question at the bottom of the announcement board with yes, you can submit your own announcement (which will go to the project with project ID 2). </p>
